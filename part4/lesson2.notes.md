# Lesson 2

### Ethereum

- Decentralized platform that runs smart contracts: applications that run exactly as programmed without any possibility of downtime, censorship, fraud, or third-party interference. - Official definition from ethereum.org
- Generalized platform that allowed users to DEVELOP ontop of it.
	- this is the previously mentioned 'world computer', and ethereums primary mission.
- Think of the ethereum network as an operating system.
	- ie, an operating system gives you the tools and resources necessary to build ontop of them.

### Bitcoin Vs Ethereum

- Bitcoin.
	- Permission restrictions: permissionless, anyone that wants to gain access or creates blocks can do so.
	- Concensus: Proof of work.
	- Scalability: High node scalability, low performance scalability - struggles to scale its performance.
		- bitcoin transactions take 10 ish minutes
	- Regulation: Low, decentralized decision making by community.
	- Anonymity: Pseudonymity - identity is tied to a users private key.
	- Scripting: Limited possibilities
- Ethereum
	- Permission restrictions: permissionless, anyone that wants to gain access or creates blocks can do so.
	- Concensus: Proof of work, casper will introduce proof of stake concept TBD.
	- Scalability: High node scalability, low performance scalability - struggles to scale its performance.
		- ethereum takes 15 seconds
		- this may seem huge, but compared to visa and mastercard which process 5000 transactions a second, this is a huge setback 
	- Regulation: Medium, core developer group.
	- Anonymity: Pseudonymity - identity is tied to a users private key.
	- Scripting: Turing complete virtual machine
