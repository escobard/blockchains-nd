# Lesson 3

## Smart Contracts

- Programs that can be ran on the Ethereum network.
- Each call to a smart contract is verified by all notes participating in the smart contract.
- This idea of a smart contract was proposed initially by Nick Szabo in 1996.
- Ethereum is the first blockchain to implement the idea of a smart contract.

- Turing complete:
	- smart contract code can have non-deterministic conditional branching, jumps, and for loops.
	- in other words, calling a computer Turing complete means that it can execute any algorithm

### ICO

- projects that raised billions of dollars, offered different types of ethereum services.
- these programs have ranged from games, to providing services, to art, insurance, loans, derivitives, and even keeping track of physical property.
- Today there are over 1000 such projects that have made their own token on top of ethereum, with smart contracts.
- A prime example of a great ICO is crypto kitties.

### CryptoKitties

- breed and raise digital cats, buy with ether.

- can go as low as a few dollars, to the highest recorded sell being $140,000.

- depends on the rarity of the cat, breed, etc.

### Solidity

- mostly compared to javascript and c++

### Remix

- To save time, refer to udemy repo for solidity and remix syntax basics

### CryptoPunks

- https://www.larvalabs.com/cryptopunks
- cool application that has unique characters with proof of ownership stored on the ethereum blockchain.

### Etherscan

- We can view more information about users, by grabbing the users address.
- https://etherscan.io/address/0xc352b534e8b987e036a93539fd6897f53488e56a#tokentxns
- allows us to see transactions, values, tokens purchased.
- is great for general information of an account, but does not allow great information of which token the account wallet holds.

### Rarebits

- Allows for browsing of crypto tokens / assets in any given account.
