## Intro to Wallet types
	
	- wallets actually contain keys, not coins.
	- The term wallet is a bit misleading.
	- they can be thought of more as keychains.

### Non-Deterministic

	- These wallets are simply collections of randomly generated private keys.
	- Private keys are randomly generated between 1 and 2^256

### Deterministic wallet

#### Sequential deterministic

	- these wallets contain private keys that are derived sequentially from a single seed and can be traced back to that seed.
	- Private keys are generated with sha256(seed+n), where seed = 128 random bits

#### Hierarchical Deterministic Wallet

	- HD wallet for short.
	- This is the most complex form of sequential deterministic wallets.
	- These wallets are created in a tree based hirerachy, where the parent keys can have children keys, and grandchildren keys.

#### Non-Deterministic

	- These wallets are simply collections of randomly generated private keys.
	- Private key = randomly generated between 1 and 2^256

#### Mnemonic Words

	- were created to make it easier for the user to remember how to recover their account.
