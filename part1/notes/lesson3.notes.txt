## Intro to Wallet types
	
	- wallets actually contain keys, not coins.
	- The term wallet is a bit misleading.
	- they can be thought of more as keychains.

### Non-Deterministic

	- These wallets are simply collections of randomly generated private keys.
	- Private keys are randomly generated between 1 and 2^256

### Deterministic wallet

#### Sequential deterministic

	- these wallets contain private keys that are derived sequentially from a single seed and can be traced back to that seed.
	- Private keys are generated with sha256(seed+n), where seed = 128 random bits

#### Hierarchical Deterministic Wallet

	- HD wallet for short.
	- This is the most complex form of sequential deterministic wallets.
	- These wallets are created in a tree based hirerachy, where the parent keys can have children keys, and grandchildren keys.
	- 

#### Non-Deterministic

	- These wallets are simply collections of randomly generated private keys.
	- Private key = randomly generated between 1 and 2^256

#### Mnemonic Words

	- were created to make it easier for the user to remember how to recover their account.

## Private Keys

- None of these keys are actually stored on the blockchain, these are instead presented to the blockchain.
- A private key is just a 256-bit random number between 1 and 2^256 - this is a huge number.
- Its best to use an industry established private key generator to ensure private key uniqueness.
- private keys generate public keys and wallet addreses which allow us to interact with the blockchain network and other users in the network.

### Different formats include:
	
	- all still represent the same 256 private key number, encoded differently
	- Hex: 256 character number
	- Wallet Import Format (WIF) with (BASE58Check): 
	- WIF-Compressed (Base58Check added suffix 0x01 before encoding)

### Creating private keys

#### Bitaddress.org 
	- create a randomly generated number based on the OS's random number generator, used for private keys.
	- Move the mouse around to create characters / uniqueness.
	- Its recommended to create a private key offline with this creator, in order to ensure security.

#### Electrum
	
	- you can export your private keys in json or CSV form
