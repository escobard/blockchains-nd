## Lesson 2 

### Influence of Blockchain

 - blockchains enable us to share data in a completely new way.
 - allows us to make transactions in a way that is more secure, transparent, and cheaper than previously
 - we can do all of this without large companies collecting our data like they do today

#### Personal Identity

	- we all want to keep our identity safe, to secure our privacy
	- large coorporations keep all our data, which has major security risks which jeapordize our privacy.
	- these databases being hacked reveal our private information.


#### Supply Chain
	- decentralized networks do not contain data in a single centralized database - its shared with everyone and verified by the network 
	- makes data breaches nearly impossible
	- Supply chain management is de-centralized and tracked by many companies, making the management of inventory messy, and often innacurate.

#### Impact on other industries

	- Medicine: more secure and accurate patient information.
	- Finance: Can freely send money around the world.
	- Government: Can be made more secure and transparent on the blockchain.

### Financial Transactions:

#### Problems blockchains aim to solve, and solutions it provides

	- A trusted currency with intristic value, is the main purpose of cryptocurrencies.
	- We created the banking system to keep currencies secure, and centralized to maintain its value.
		- banks helped establish the confidence needed to make safe transactions.
		- they keep a record of all transactions we keep records of, in a transaction sheet / db called the ledger.
		- These are kept to ensure transaction validity, and prevent fraud.
	- The bank system has a few major problems, which cryptocurrencies aim to address:
		- Fees - bank takes tons of fees.
		- Not just banks handle our transactions, many companies can be involved which causes even more fees.
		- this causes delays and additional fees when sending money to other countries or continents.
	- This is why Bitcoin was created, in an attempt to address the problems above.

### Simple Transactions:

#### What are the issues we face?

- Sending money from one person to another:
	- Goes through the senders bank, the receivers bank, then the receiver.
	- Each involved party needs to keep track of their own ledger
	- Parties need to pass along information
	- Risk of not being in sync.
	- ledger is where transaction details are involved.

### Blockchains, Bitcoin and Crypto

- Transactions with cryptocurrencies have a shared ledger.
	- Removes the needs for bansk to help manage our transaction.
	- Up to date, out in the open, and verified by everyone. 
	- This is whats known as a trustless system.
	- The system itself handles the security necessary to handle the transactions.
- The security is ensured by using cryptography, which encrypts all transaction blocks. 
- Cryptocurrency - a system that uses cryptography to ensure security to its value, is called a cryptocurrency.
- Bitcoin is a decentralized digital cryptocurrency powered by a shared digital ledger known as the blockchain.
- Any blockchain is in essence a shared digital ledger
- Each transaction is grouped together in something known as a block.
	- Each block is verified by other members in the networks.
	- These members are known as nodes.
	- Once our block has been verified, it is added to the rest of the blocks, forming a blockchain.

### History of Bitcoin

- https://bitcoin.org/bitcoin.pdf (bitcoin whitepaper)

- How to timestamp in a nutshell:
	- developed a new way to verify document by using timestamps.
	- these timestamps are also linked to the previous document
	- explains how it can form a chain of validated up to date documents
	- this became the precursor to the idea of blockchains

- Bitcoin whitepaper in a nutshell:
	- Explains how peer-to-peer transactions were introduced into the world and their impact
	- a pure peer-to-peer transaction that allows online payments from one party to another without going through a financial institution
	- A purely peer-to-peer version of electronic cash would allow online
	payments to be sent directly from one party to another without going through a
	financial institution. Digital signatures provide part of the solution, but the main
	benefits are lost if a trusted third party is still required to prevent double-spending.
	We propose a solution to the double-spending problem using a peer-to-peer network.
	The network timestamps transactions by hashing them into an ongoing chain of
	hash-based proof-of-work, forming a record that cannot be changed without redoing
	the proof-of-work. The longest chain not only serves as proof of the sequence of
	events witnessed, but proof that it came from the largest pool of CPU power. As
	long as a majority of CPU power is controlled by nodes that are not cooperating to
	attack the network, they'll generate the longest chain and outpace attackers. The
	network itself requires minimal structure. Messages are broadcast on a best effort
	basis, and nodes can leave and rejoin the network at will, accepting the longest
	proof-of-work chain as proof of what happened while they were gone.
