## Lesson 2 

### Influence of Blockchain

 - blockchains enable us to share data in a completely new way.
 - allows us to make transactions in a way that is more secure, transparent, and cheaper than previously
 - we can do all of this without large companies collecting our data like they do today

#### Personal Identity

	- we all want to keep our identity safe, to secure our privacy
	- large coorporations keep all our data, which has major security risks which jeapordize our privacy.
	- these databases being hacked reveal our private information.


#### Supply Chain
	- decentralized networks do not contain data in a single centralized database - its shared with everyone and verified by the network 
	- makes data breaches nearly impossible
	- Supply chain management is de-centralized and tracked by many companies, making the management of inventory messy, and often innacurate.

#### Impact on other industries

	- Medicine: more secure and accurate patient information.
	- Finance: Can freely send money around the world.
	- Government: Can be made more secure and transparent on the blockchain.

### Financial Transactions:

#### Problems blockchains aim to solve, and solutions it provides

	- A trusted currency with intristic value, is the main purpose of cryptocurrencies.
	- We created the banking system to keep currencies secure, and centralized to maintain its value.
		- banks helped establish the confidence needed to make safe transactions.
		- they keep a record of all transactions we keep records of, in a transaction sheet / db called the ledger.
		- These are kept to ensure transaction validity, and prevent fraud.
	- The bank system has a few major problems, which cryptocurrencies aim to address:
		- Fees - bank takes tons of fees.
		- Not just banks handle our transactions, many companies can be involved which causes even more fees.
		- this causes delays and additional fees when sending money to other countries or continents.
	- This is why Bitcoin was created, in an attempt to address the problems above.

### Simple Transactions:

#### What are the issues we face?

- Sending money from one person to another:
	- Goes through the senders bank, the receivers bank, then the receiver.
	- Each involved party needs to keep track of their own ledger
	- Parties need to pass along information
	- Risk of not being in sync.
	- ledger is where transaction details are involved.

### Blockchains, Bitcoin and Crypto

- Transactions with cryptocurrencies have a shared ledger.
	- Removes the needs for bansk to help manage our transaction.
	- Up to date, out in the open, and verified by everyone. 
	- This is whats known as a trustless system.
	- The system itself handles the security necessary to handle the transactions.
- The security is ensured by using cryptography, which encrypts all transaction blocks. 
- Cryptocurrency - a system that uses cryptography to ensure security to its value, is called a cryptocurrency.
- Bitcoin is a decentralized digital cryptocurrency powered by a shared digital ledger known as the blockchain.
- Any blockchain is in essence a shared digital ledger
- Each transaction is grouped together in something known as a block.
	- Each block is verified by other members in the networks.
	- These members are known as nodes.
	- Once our block has been verified, it is added to the rest of the blocks, forming a blockchain.

### History of Bitcoin

#### Supporting Material:

- https://www.anf.es/pdf/Haber_Stornetta.pdf (time stamp a digital document)
- https://bitcoin.org/bitcoin.pdf (bitcoin whitepaper)

- How to timestamp in a nutshell:
	- developed a new way to verify document by using timestamps.
	- these timestamps are also linked to the previous document
	- explains how it can form a chain of validated up to date documents
	- this became the precursor to the idea of blockchains

- Bitcoin whitepaper in a nutshell:
	- Explains how peer-to-peer transactions were introduced into the world and their impact
	- a pure peer-to-peer transaction that allows online payments from one party to another without going through a financial institution
	- A purely peer-to-peer version of electronic cash would allow online
	payments to be sent directly from one party to another without going through a
	financial institution. Digital signatures provide part of the solution, but the main
	benefits are lost if a trusted third party is still required to prevent double-spending.
	We propose a solution to the double-spending problem using a peer-to-peer network.
	The network timestamps transactions by hashing them into an ongoing chain of
	hash-based proof-of-work, forming a record that cannot be changed without redoing
	the proof-of-work. The longest chain not only serves as proof of the sequence of
	events witnessed, but proof that it came from the largest pool of CPU power. As
	long as a majority of CPU power is controlled by nodes that are not cooperating to
	attack the network, they'll generate the longest chain and outpace attackers. The
	network itself requires minimal structure. Messages are broadcast on a best effort
	basis, and nodes can leave and rejoin the network at will, accepting the longest
	proof-of-work chain as proof of what happened while they were gone.

### Bitcoin Whitepaper:

#### Introduction

	- talks about how financial systems act as third parties to establish trust
	- reversible payments: are the ability to dispute and change a transaction 
	- reversible payments increase the need of third party usage
	- without access to this information, the company would not have the ability to reverse a transaction
	- adds a lot of overhead which results in higher costs
	- they propose a solution to this problem
	- an electronic payment system based on cryptography that could establish a trustless system that would allow anyone to make transactions without needing a third party

#### Transactions

	- describes how transactions will happen in the network.
	- describe how banks have solved the double spending problem: double spending is when users pay the same amount of money more than once.
	- for a financial system to work properly, this can't be possible
	- banks defend from double spending by keeping track of all transactions that have ever taken place
	- banks know when double spending is occurring, due to keeping track of all transaction data
	- instead of having a bank keep track of transaction data, we give public access to this data for all users, with crytpocurrency blockchains

#### Timestamping

	- every bitcoin transaction that takes place, includes a timestamp of when it happened.
	- essentially if someone tries to cheat the system and send money twice, they wont be able to
	- the timestamp ensures this by keeping track of WHEN a transaction took place.

#### Proof of Work

	- there needs to be ways to validate information to ensure trust
	- there needs to be rules, ways to make decisions, and ways to validate transactions
	- in bitcoin, group concensus drives decisions and the way to make these decisions is proof of work
	- proof of work at a high level is the idea that if you've done work to figure something out and the majority of people agree with you, then it must be right
	- majority rules in the blockchain
	- as long as we can trust the majority of the network is honest, we can trust that the transaction is accurate
	- if the majority of the chains are innacurate, they can take control of a blockchain network. This is known as a 51% attack, which will be covered later.

#### Network

	1) New transactions are broadcast to all nodes.
	2) Each node collects new transactions into a block.
	3) Each node works on finding a difficult proof-of-work for its block.
	4) When a node finds a proof-of-work, it broadcasts the block to all nodes.
	5) Nodes accept the block only if all transactions in it are valid and not already spent
	6) Nodes express their acceptance of the block by working on creating the next block in the chain, using the hash of the accepted block as the previous hash

#### Incentive

	- Drive the network to validate transactions through mining.
	- Mining is how the blockchain utilizes peer-to-peer networks to validate transactions.
	- After mining a block, the miner is awarded a small amount of bitcoin for their effort.
	- Like gold miners that spend time and money to find gold, uses electricity and CPU time to earn bitcoin.
	- The incentive to mine these coins keeps the miners working, which in turn keeps the network running.

#### Reclaiming Disk Space

	- Lots of transactions means lots of data, which affects the speed of the network.
	- To ensure data optimal efficiency, the network stores data in what is called a hash, which stores encrypted data in a few characters, ensuring that each transaction no matter how large is stored in 64 characters.
	- These hashes can be used to decrypt a block if needed, which ensures that the data is compacted and small to save disk space.

#### Simple payment verification

	- Normally to test a transaction we need access to the entire ledger.
	- This means you would have to download the transaction records for the ENTIRE network.
	- Simple payment verification describes a way to verify the transaction without needing to access the entire ledger.
	- By cross referencing and checking the previous block's hash, it ensures the authenticity.

#### Combining and Splitting value

	- Individually processing coins is possible, but it isn't very efficient to make a new transaction for every cent in the transfer.
	- To deal with this, bitcoin makes it possible to split, or recombine the value of coins.
	- This allows us to break down a large coin into many parts, or for a small coin to be combined.
	- Similar to a cashier, where change is expected in return for a monetary transaction, or when change is expected in splitting larger bills.

#### Privacy

	- To ensure privacy, bitcoin changes the flow of information in comparison to a bank
	- Your identity is used to varify transactions, which can't be hidden from the public.
	- Bitcoin hides your identity within transactions, ensuring that all transactions are anonymous.

#### Calculations:
	
	- Won't be reviewed in the program, but in a nutshell this section outlines the complex mathematics used to ensure the security of the blockchain.

### Blockchain Core Components

#### Block
	
	- small packages of data including transaction information
	- each given a unique fingerprints, which is known as hashing
	- hash is a digital fingerprint for information.
	- hashes are created by passing data through a hash algorythm.
	- this algorythm takes data and encrypts it into a hash.
	- you use this hash value whenever you want to search for the original information
	- similar to social security numbers, phone numbers or addresses. 
	- each new block contains the hash value of the block before it.
	- this links blocks together, which is what builds the blockchain.

#### Peer to peer networks

	- These connect the members of the network with one another.
	- This allows them to send information between each other.
	- The bitcoin and the blockchain uses this idea to create and validate new blocks.
	- allows anyone in the network to send transactions to anyone else
	- it allows anyone on the network to validate any blocks and transactions that happen.
	- this allows the network to be controlled by the members rather than any large centralized system like a bank.
	- concensus is the term of how members in the network come to an agreement to make decisions.

### Simple Blockchain transactions

#### Wallets

	- Wallet address: used to communicate between wallets, send funds, transactions, etc.
	- Wallet addresses are not communicated with transaction hashes, and are hidden from the public.
	- Wallets store keys, they do not contain coins or any currency, they store your public and private keys - think of them as keychains instead of a traditional wallet.

#### Keys
	
	- Public keys can be shared.
	- Public keys are created USING private keys and a secure algorythm.
	- Once the public key is created, it shouldn't be possible to determine what the original public key was.
	- The algorythm that creates the public key is known as the one way elliptic curve digital signature (ECDSA)
	- Private keys should not be shared, and should be handled with extreme caution.

#### Address 
	
	- Like a public address, tells users where to send money to.
	- Addresses are created by running the PUBLIC key through an algorythm to create the address.
	- The public key is ran through the Secure Hash Algoyrthm (SHA-256), and the RIPEMD160 algrorythm.
	- This is then ran through a BASE58CHECK algorythm, removing similar characters, like 0 to O or 1 to I.
	-
