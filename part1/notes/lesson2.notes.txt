## Lesson 2 

### Influence of Blockchain

 - blockchains enable us to share data in a completely new way.
 - allows us to make transactions in a way that is more secure, transparent, and cheaper than previously
 - we can do all of this without large companies collecting our data like they do today

#### Personal Identity

	- we all want to keep our identity safe, to secure our privacy
	- large coorporations keep all our data, which has major security risks which jeapordize our privacy.
	- these databases being hacked reveal our private information.


#### Supply Chain
	- decentralized networks do not contain data in a single centralized database - its shared with everyone and verified by the network 
	- makes data breaches nearly impossible
	- Supply chain management is de-centralized and tracked by many companies, making the management of inventory messy, and often innacurate.

#### Impact on other industries

	- Medicine: more secure and accurate patient information.
	- Finance: Can freely send money around the world.
	- Government: Can be made more secure and transparent on the blockchain.
