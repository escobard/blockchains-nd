## Lesson 2 

### Influence of Blockchain

 - blockchains enable us to share data in a completely new way.
 - allows us to make transactions in a way that is more secure, transparent, and cheaper than previously
 - we can do all of this without large companies collecting our data like they do today

#### Personal Identity

	- we all want to keep our identity safe, to secure our privacy
	- large coorporations keep all our data, which has major security risks which jeapordize our privacy.
	- these databases being hacked reveal our private information.


#### Supply Chain
	- decentralized networks do not contain data in a single centralized database - its shared with everyone and verified by the network 
	- makes data breaches nearly impossible
	- Supply chain management is de-centralized and tracked by many companies, making the management of inventory messy, and often innacurate.

#### Impact on other industries

	- Medicine: more secure and accurate patient information.
	- Finance: Can freely send money around the world.
	- Government: Can be made more secure and transparent on the blockchain.

### Financial Transactions:

#### Problems blockchains aim to solve, and solutions it provides

	- A trusted currency with intristic value, is the main purpose of cryptocurrencies.
	- We created the banking system to keep currencies secure, and centralized to maintain its value.
		- banks helped establish the confidence needed to make safe transactions.
		- they keep a record of all transactions we keep records of, in a transaction sheet / db called the ledger.
		- These are kept to ensure transaction validity, and prevent fraud.
	- The bank system has a few major problems, which cryptocurrencies aim to address:
		- Fees - bank takes tons of fees.
		- Not just banks handle our transactions, many companies can be involved which causes even more fees.
		- this causes delays and additional fees when sending money to other countries or continents.
	- This is why Bitcoin was created, in an attempt to address the problems above.

### Simple Transactions:

#### What are the issues we face?

- Sending money from one person to another:
	- Goes through the senders bank, the receivers bank, then the receiver.
	- Each involved party needs to keep track of their own ledger
	- Parties need to pass along information
	- Risk of not being in sync.
	- ledger is where transaction details are involved.

### Blockchains, Bitcoin and Crypto

- Transactions with cryptocurrencies have a shared ledger.
	- Removes the needs for bansk to help manage our transaction.
	- Up to date, out in the open, and verified by everyone. 
	- This is whats known as a trustless system.
	- The system itself handles the security necessary to handle the transactions.
- The security is ensured by using cryptography, which encrypts all transaction blocks. 
- Cryptocurrency - a system that uses cryptography to ensure security to its value, is called a cryptocurrency.
- Bitcoin is a decentralized digital cryptocurrency powered by a shared digital ledger known as the blockchain.
- Any blockchain is in essence a shared digital ledger
- Each transaction is grouped together in something known as a block.
	- Each block is verified by other members in the networks.
	- These members are known as nodes.
	- Once our block has been verified, it is added to the rest of the blocks, forming a blockchain.
