# Lesson 5

## Private and Public blockchains
	- in all public blockchains, we are all able to participate without needing explicit permission.

### Public vs Private blockchains
	- Public:
		- permissions - permissionless
			- allows anyone to participate or benefit from the technology
			- this allows for the users to interact with the blockchain without building their own ecosystem.
			- the success of bitcoins public protocol let to the creation of Ethereum, which enhances the original bitcoin protocols.
			- are permissionless and can be maintained by anyone with sufficient computing power to do so.
			- allows for full transparency of the information contained.
		- scalability - more difficult
			- transactions on the public chain are time restrictive.
		- vulnerability - less vulnerable
			- time restrictions improve security and control supply, but impact scalability of transactions that the platform can process at any given time.
		- compliance - more difficult
			- when nations enact laws against blockchain protocols, 
	- Private:
		- permissions - permissioned
			- closed, require permission
			- typically operate under centralized control.
		- scalability - simpler
			- efficiency with scalability and regulatory requirements
			- 
		- vulnerability - more vulnerable
			- vulnerability of their network, due to centralized governance (private blockchains are considered centralized, since the chain is not share publically).
			- low transparency they restrict information from being seen by the general public, they also rely on limited private networks to maintain the integrity of the blockchain itself.
		- compliance - less difficult
