## Bitcoin Core - Overview

### Bitcoin Network
	- Network of bitcoin users creating and validating transactions.
	- Different from a the bitcoin core, which handles the software development of applications

### Bitcoin Core 
	- Implementation of bitcoin that encompasses all of the software behind bitcoin.
	- This is where the libraries that fuel bitcoin applications comes from.

#### Bitcoin transaction verification engine
	- allowing you to verify transactions happening on the bitgoin network.

#### Explore and validate the entire bitcoin blockchain

### Debug Console
	- tool that allows you to interact with data on the bitcoin blockchain (similar to ethereum's remix: https://remix.ethereum.org/)

## Bitcoin Core - Networks

	- will be using 3 networks to build applications with this course for bitcoin

### Mainnet
	- primary bitcoin transactions take place on this network
	- live transactions, has value and contains peers, slowest network
	- vs Testnet:
		- Purpose - Production
		- Environment - Public
		- Peers - Entire network
		- Size - 200GB
		- Block creation - 10 minutes
		- Value - Full Value
		- Public key prefix: 1
		- Block difficulty - Full - Self adjusted dependent of block creation net

### Testnet
	- for testing, no value, has peers
	- alternative bitcoin blockchain which helps the testing of applications
	- creating new blocks, and validating new blockchains takes time - slows down the network
	- People have hoarded test coins:
		- it makes it more difficult for developers to continue testing with the network.
		- Because of this, developers have started from scratch to wipe the network 
	- vs Mainnet:
		- Purpose - testing
		- Environment - Public
		- Peers - Active testers
		- Size - 14GB
		- Block creation - 10 minutes
		- Value - No value
		- public key prefix: **m** or **n**
		- block difficulty - Half of mainnet, takes less computing power
	- vs Regnet:
		- Purpose - testing
		- Environment - Public
		- Peers - Active testers
		- Size - 14GB
		- Block creation - 10 minutes
		- Value - No value
		- public key prefix: **m** or **n**
		- block difficulty - Half of mainnet, takes less computing power

### Regnet - Regression Test Mode Network
	- for testing, no value, no peers
	- not on a network, takes almost no time
	vs Regnet
		- Purpose - testing
		- Environment - Private, completely local to your own computer
		- Peers - No peers
		- Size - 0GB
		- Block creation - instantly, since there is no block validation
		- Value - No value
		- public key prefix: **m** or **n**
		- block difficulty - no difficulty

### Bitcoin Core - Wallet
	- Fully validates transactions and blocks.
	- By downloading the bitcoin core waller, we create a node which interacts with the bitcoin network.
	- Multiple options are available, but we are using bitcoin core for our purposes.
	- very similar to other wallet interfaces, no need to expand.

### Bitcoin Core - Networks
	- all can be accessed using the bitcoin core client
	- to connect to other networks, we can use the bitcoin.conf file.
		- to connect to any network, type the network name, equal sign, and a 1 like so:
			- `testnet=1`
			- any of these can be commented out by using the # pretext like so:
			- `#testnet=1`
		- the bitcoin core client must be shut down in order for this to work.
		- accessing the regnet is exactly the same as with bitcoin

### Bitcoin core - test network coin faucet
	- faucets come and go, but we can find current faucets for testnet here: https://testnet.manu.backend.hamburg/faucet
	- copy your address into the input to get coins

### Bitcoin Core - debugger
	- for a list of commands, (won't list all here, only most used) type in help into the console

### Bitcoin Core - blockchains
	- getblockchaininfo: Returns various state information about blockchain processing.
	- getblockcount: Returns the number of blocks in the blockchain.
	- verifychain: Verifies blockchain database.

### Bitcoin core - hash commands
	- getblockhash: Returns hash of a block at the block number provided
	- getnetworkhashps: Returns an estimated network hashes per second based on a specified number of recent blocks.
	- getbestblockhash: Returns the hash of the best block.
	- best block - most recent block you've synced to with your local copy of the chain.
	- hash value: digital fingerprint for information

### Bitcoin core - blocks
	- getblock: Returns details of block information.
	- getblockheader: Returns information about the block header.
	- generate: Immediately mines the specified number of blocks to an address in the wallet

### Bitcoin core - wallet
	- getwalletinfo: Returns an object containing various information about a walletâ€™s state.
	- listwallets: Returns a list of currently loaded wallets.

### Bitcoin core - mempool
	- getmempoolinfo: Returns details on the active state of the transaction memory pool.
	- getrawmempool: Returns all transaction details in the memory pool.
	- getmempoolentry: Returns mempool data for a given transaction.

### Bitcoin core - transactions
	- getchaintxstats: Compute statistics about the total number and rate of transactions in the chain
	- getrawtransaction: Returns raw transaction data
	- listtransactions: Returns a list of transactions for a given account

### Bitcoin core - signature commands
	- signrawtransaction: Sign inputs for a raw transaction.
	- signmessage: Sign message with the private key of an address.

### Bitcoin core - network
	- getnetworkinfo: Returns information about the state of the peer-to-peer network.
	- getpeerinfo: Returns data about each connection network node.
	- getconnectioncount: Returns the number of connections to other nodes.

### Bitcoin core - mining
	- getmininginfo: Returns an object that contains mining-related information.
	- getblocktemplate: Returns data needed to construct a block.
	- prioritisetransaction: Accepts the transaction into mined blocks at a higher or lower priority.
